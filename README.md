# SOLAR-BASED-WATER-PUMPING-SYSTEM-FOR-ELECTRICAL-ENGINEERING
When sun light falls on panel in solar panel made by silicon and germanium. It is convert photon energy to electric energy. So the solar cell converts in electrical energy in dc system. And also USB battery in hole day battery charge use dc supply in street light and water level indicator and water pump in agriculture system.
## Introduction
Energy is a key ingredient for the overall development of an economy. India has been endowed with abundant renewable solar energy resource. India is large country and the rate of electrification has not kept pace with the expanding population, urbanization and industrialization and has resulted in the increasing deficit between demand and supply of electricity. This has not only resulted in under electrification but also put heavy pressure on the governments to keep pace with demand for electricity. People not served by the power grid have to rely on fossil fuels like kerosene and diesel for the poor people in rural areas.
### Applications
It is mostly use in farm.
It is used in industries or factory which is far away frome the city.
It is used in tube well.
It can also use in animal caring.
